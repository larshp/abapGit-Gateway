# abapGit-Gateway
Work in progress, see https://github.com/larshp/abapGit/issues/75

Initially this repository will be used for developing support for object type IWPR in abapGit.

For testing purposes it can be installed alongside abapGit in a separate include.

Whenever(if) it becomes stable the code will be moved to to the abapGit repository. However abapGit version requirement is 702, so everything will have to be changed into dynamic references.
